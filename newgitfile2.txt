s is the newer version of vim installed.
This even has a backspace.
I know its dumb.
To edit a file we use vi<space>the files name.
If the file name doesnt exist, it creates a new file.
Now i deleted the created file as i didnt give the .txt extension to it.
Use rm- rf<space> file name to delete a file.
